Hello! :wave: I am a final-year dual-degree student majoring in [**Aerospace Engineering**](http://www.ae.iitkgp.ac.in/) at the [*Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur*](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/). My primary area of study is *astrodynamics*, and I am currently researching the **circular restricted three-body problem** and **spacecraft trajectory optimization**. Some of my projects can be found on [Github](https://github.com/swtnikita50). <br>
I'd love an opportunity to learn more about *satellite constellation design* and *space situational awareness*. My projects are detailed in the [projects section]().

> Prof. Manoranjan Sinha <br>
> Description: My thesis is an attempt to understand the CR3BP intimately and understand how it is used in spacecraft trajectory design. It involves studying the chaos of the CR3BP in an orderly manner and making use of that chaos itself to generate trajectories which use far less fuel and can satisfy the mission constraints.

Background
-----
Growing up in a busy state like Delhi, my family background has always been one of hard work and perseverance. My parents have been a constant source of inspiration, with my father working in the fire safety department of the government and my mother supporting our family of five by working as a tailor.

Despite the challenges, I have always been a bright student and a well-rounded individual. In school, I was the associate head girl and won several district-level competitions in speech and science student seminar. I even secured the school rank 1 and national rank 1600 in the Science Olympiad in class 6.

Driven by my interest in science, I pursued Aerospace Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, where I excelled not only academically but also in sports, leadership, and volunteering. As a skilled athlete, I have achieved several accolades in volleyball and running, and I even served as the Captain of my hostel's volleyball team for two years, leading my team to gold medals.

In addition to my sports achievements, I have also been actively involved in volunteering for women's empowerment. As the General Secretary Sports at Sister Nivedita Hall and the Department Women Representative for Aerospace, I organized events like "Women in Research" and "International Women's Day," connecting female students with alums working in research and celebrating women's achievements.

My skills also extend beyond sports and volunteering. I have a passion for creativity, and I like to code, design logos, and make animated videos. My technical skills have been put to use in various projects, both in academics and extracurricular activities.

Overall, my diverse background, leadership and volunteering experience, and creative and technical skills make me a well-rounded individual, poised for success in any field I choose to pursue.

Extra-curricular Interests
-----
I enjoy tiring my muscles on the rythem of music while dancing, gymming, running or sketching. Along with that I like to read good novels from time to time which gives me break from my technical side and takes me into the sweet wonderland of literature. When novels become too monotonic I find myself enjoying more technical and creative side of me like working on this website or random logo deisgn or maybe coding animated videos. 
Exploring new activities and enjoying learning them is my favorite hobby I can say:)
